A car rental system serves several important purposes, primarily for the convenience 
    of customers who need temporary access to a vehicle. The main purposes of a car 
    rental system are as follows:

1. Providing Temporary Transportation: Car rental systems allow individuals and 
    businesses to rent vehicles for a specified period, typically on a hourly, daily, 
    weekly, or monthly basis.

2. Flexibility: Car rental systems offer flexibility in terms of vehicle selection 
    and rental duration. Customers can choose from a variety of vehicle types (e.g., 
    economy cars, SUVs, luxury cars) to suit their specific needs. They can also rent 
    vehicles for short-term or long-term periods based on their requirements.

3. Cost Savings: Renting a car can be cost-effective for customers who only need a 
    vehicle on occasion or for a short period.

4. Convenience: Car rental companies typically offer pick-up and drop-off services 
    at various locations, including airports, train stations, and local rental 
    offices. This convenience makes it easy for customers to access transportation 
    when and where they need it.

5. Access to Specialized Vehicles: Car rental systems often provide access to 
    specialized vehicles like vans, trucks, or luxury cars, which may not be practical 
    for everyday ownership but are needed for specific tasks or events.
